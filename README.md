-----
This is a Go port of the core elements of the Open Source [Predict program](http://www.qsl.net/kd2bd/predict.html), written by John A. Magliacane (KD2BD).

Dr. T.S. Kelso is the author of the SGP4/SDP4 orbital models, originally written in Fortran and Pascal, and released into the public domain through his website: [www.celestrak.com](http://www.celestrak.com)

Neoklis Kyriazis, 5B4AZ, later re-wrote Dr. Kelso's code in C, and released it under the GNU GPL in 2002. PREDICT's core is based on 5B4AZ's code translation efforts.
